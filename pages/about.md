I’m a programmer with a focus on programming languages and open hardwares. At the moment, I’m working at [Hexaware](http://hexaware.com/) as a "System Analyst" developing a ADM (Application Development and Maintenance) platform for Innovation Lab.

I enjoy debugging, solving problems and try my level best to help fellow programmers. [Linux Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) is my preferred operation system. I use free/open-source software almost exclusively as much as possible.

I studied BCA(Computer Science) parttime at Tilak Mahrashtra Vidyapeeth, Pune (2009).

I have fun with programming software and hardwares. I do by my hobby. I like to programme mainly on [Python](http://python.org).
